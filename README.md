# SliverAppBar with CustomScrollView

This Flutter app demonstrates the use of a `SliverAppBar` combined with a `CustomScrollView` to create a scrolling effect with multiple sliver items. The app showcases how to implement a flexible, responsive UI with scrollable content and a customizable app bar.

## Features
- **SliverAppBar**: A customizable app bar that scrolls along with the content, with options to pin or float.
- **CustomScrollView**: Manages multiple sliver items that can be scrolled vertically.
- **FlexibleSpaceBar**: An expandable app bar with a background image and dynamic title behavior.
- **Sliver Items**: Multiple `SliverToBoxAdapter` items styled with padding, rounded corners, and different colors.

## Code Explanation

- **`MyApp` class**: Initializes the app and applies the theme.
- **`HomePage` class**: Implements the core UI, including the `CustomScrollView` and `SliverAppBar`.
- **SliverAppBar**: 
  - **Floating**: The app bar appears as you scroll up.
  - **Pinned**: Optionally pins the app bar so it stays visible at the top.
  - **FlexibleSpaceBar**: Expands or collapses the app bar while scrolling.
- **SliverToBoxAdapter**: Adds multiple styled containers to the scroll view, each with padding and a background color.

## Customization

- **ExpandedHeight**: Modify the `expandedHeight` property of `SliverAppBar` to control how much space it occupies when fully expanded.
- **Pin/Floating**: Toggle the `floating` and `pinned` properties of `SliverAppBar` to adjust its behavior during scroll events.
